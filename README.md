### Building

The API and localization files reside in their own repository. It is pulled in automatically.

You need to put the Ic2 and CraftGuide APIs in "../IC2/src/" and "../CraftGuide/src" respectively. Hopefully that can be automated in the future.

You will need to define a "./gradle.properties" file.

Sample properties file:
```
mcversion=1.7.2
forgeversion=10.12.1.1061
version_major=2
version_minor=4
version_patch=0
version_revision=0
version_build=0
mcUsername=SirSengir
mcPassword=password
```

To setup, open a command line and run "gradlew setupDecompWorkspace" and "gradlew eclipse".

To package, open a command line and type "gradlew release".

### Notes

Beware of ugly code.

Bugfixes are generally welcome. If you want to contribute something which changes game mechanics, please talk to someone with commit privileges first. Nothing is more frustrating than putting a lot of work and effort into a new game mechanic and then having the PR rejected because it doesnâ€™t fit gameplay-wise.

If you submit a PR you must accept the Contributor License Agreement. There is no way around that, since otherwise changing the license later - even to something more permissive! - , becomes close to impossible.
