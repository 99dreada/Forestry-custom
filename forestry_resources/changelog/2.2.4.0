#2.2.4.0

- Added: Alveary sieve to filter out pollen collected by bees. Requires woven silk as sieve material. Sieve material is destroyed and needs to be replaced when removing any pollen from the sieve.
- Added: Fertile pollen. Contains the same genetic information as saplings and can be applied directly to leaves.
- Added: Butterflies as collectible items. Forestry trees now occasionally spawn butterflies. The type of butterfly spawned depends on several factors, including biome. Butterflies do not yet serve a purpose. They are however pretty.
- Added: Flutterlyzer to take a look at the genetic traits of butterflies. You cannot breed butterflies yet though, so this serves only informational purposes. 
- Changed: Rewrote certain mutations to be compatible with biome mods. (Rural, Heroic.) (RichardG)
- Changed: Fixed some textures to reduce seams on render models.
- Bugfix: Stairs can now be placed upside down.
- Bugfix: Fixed a carpenter dupe bug.
