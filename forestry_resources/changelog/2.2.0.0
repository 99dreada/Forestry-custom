#2.2.0.0

- Added: 5 new bee species.
- Added: 8 new tree species.
- Added: Bee house as a low level alternative to the apiary.
- Added: Clockwork engine. Wind it up for early game energy.
- Added: Vanilla hopper support to all machines and engines.
- Changed: Trunk size on trees can now be inherited. That 3x3 cherry tree is now possible!
- Changed: Internal changes to several machines to improve performance and some interaction with other mods.
- Changed: Raintank is now an unpowered machine.
- Changed: Bottler now uses the liquid dictionary to dynamically populate its recipe list.
- Changed: Seed oil output has been rebalanced, reducing it further on easily obtainable seeds.
- Changed: Several changes to the default traits of several tree species.
- Changed: Sapling yield in the fermenter has changed. The amount of biomass produced from a single sapling is now determined by the sappiness trait on it. Saplings without genetic information are treated as though they have lowest sappiness.
- Changed: Adapted to new vanilla bonemeal behaviour for saplings.
- Changed: Added squeezable lemons and plums. (Sprites for both by Xizzzy.)
- Changed: Apple juice is now fruit juice.
- Changed: Increased the guaranteed drop from apatite by 1. Reduced the minimum world height required for apatite to spawn to 56.
- Changed: Reduced power requirements for farms a bit.
- Changed: Reduced fertilizer requirements on some of the more basic farms, including arboretum.
- Changed: Changed humus degradation behaviour. Now only degrades over time instead of on-growth of a tree.
- Changed: Drastically increased the potential generations artificial princesses ("swarmer princesses") can reproduce before genetic fatigue sets in.
- Changed: All work and no play makes the queen a dull girl: Forcing a queen to produce way too fast or trying too hard to mutate her may result in undesireable consequences. (Note: Only applies to outside factors, not to factors inherent in the queen's genetic makeup.)
- Changed: Minor improvements to treealyzer and to sapling tooltips.
