- Added: More butterflies.
- Updated: IC2 API.
- Changed: Only the most common butterfly species are shown in creative menu.
- Changed: Butterflies now have a minimum cooldown period between pollinations and egg laying.
- Changed: Butterflies will flee from players. Sneak to creep close enough for the scoop.
